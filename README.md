# GPS editor and GPX file hosting

Sadly Development of Garmin Basecamp [has been discontinue](https://forums.garmin.com/de/apps-und-software/mac-windows-software/f/garmin-basecamp-windows/10766/basecamp-weiterentwicklung-gestoppt/62383).

Garmin itself recommends using [Garmin Explore](https://explore.garmin.com), kind of an online version of Basecamp - but with not as nearly the features that Basecamp provides.


## Alternatives to Garmin Basecamp & Explore

A simple look after alternatives https://alternativeto.net/software/garmin-basecamp/ and other forums brought me to the two most promising candidates:

1.) https://www.locusmap.app

10-24€/y, also based on Mapbox

Great Apps for iOS and Android, good Web-App for planning: https://web.locusmap.app/en - but high learning curve, not as intuitive 

2.) https://gpx.studio

OpenSource! https://github.com/gpxstudio/gpx.studio Beautifully build, based on Mapbox GL JS, OSM

WebApp only https://gpx.studio/app - but really intuitive, Strg-Z works :) 


## Idea: Separate GPX-Editor & Planner from the GPX-file database

We can use an Editor - and host the files on Dropbox/GoogleDrive etc.
